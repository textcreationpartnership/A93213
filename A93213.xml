            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The next remedy of the preſent inconveniences, ſurely is to provide that they may not deſtroy one another; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry party being at eaſe, and contented within themſelves, in thoſe affaires that regard God and their owne Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and being ſecured from any encroaching or preſſures upon them that way, they may then with unanimity and comfort, joyne all their endeavours together for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and advanceing their temporall emoluments.</p>
            <p>Which courſe certainly is not onely the moſt judicious, and the moſt prudent in humane wiſedome; But is alſo the moſt pious, and the moſt godly in Divine reſpects, nay, to doe the contrary, were moſt impious and wicked; for ſince it is cleare, that no man could be ſo much an Enemy to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as to undergoe preſent and evident inconveniences for matters of Religion, if his conſcience did not aſſure him that God required it at his hands, and that it is no leſſe then a matter of damnation, wilfully to deny his obedience to his maker, the great God of Heaven and Earth, and to give it to human power, It cannot therfore be denyed, but that it is a high impiety for any power to force another unto what he beleiveth to be ſacrilegious and damnable, and extream cruelty and tyranny, to puniſh one for doeing what in his conſcience he is clearely convinced, is the only beſt; mans reaſon cannot be forced by outward violence; all that can be expected from ſuch a courſe, is to have weake mindes through humane frailty become Hypocrites; for this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable, <hi>what is not of faith is ſinne,</hi> yea it comes neere that ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, if that ſinne be to doe in the Worſhip of God contrary to the expreſſe <hi>dictamens</hi> of their owne conſcience.</p>

            <p>We may then ſafely conclude, that ſince true Religion is a ſupernaturall thing, and a meere gift of God, not posſible to be forced into mens ſoules by humane compulſion; The eſtabliſhing of it in mens mindes ought wholly to be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Divine wayes of working and planting it, for it is an effect that floweth from a ſupernaturall principle of grace, which worketh upon our hearts, by thoſe inſcrutable paths that none but God can tread: Let us then take heed of intruding our unworthy ſickles into his harveſt, leſt with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> we be in this life or the next, ſtricken dead for preſuming to prop up his Arke unwarrantably.</p>
            <p>But that it may appeare yet more evident, how unfit it is to make coercive Lawes for Religion, and mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, let us conſider how unagreeable ſuch a proceeding is aſwell to reaſon, as to the rules of Gods wiſedome and goodneſſe; thoſe that make ſuch Lawes are men: who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them never ſo good, and never ſo wiſe, yet as long as they are men, they are ſtill lyable to errour; and all their Ordinances may be defective: we finde no ſpirt of infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity promiſed to humane conſultations; Amongſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> was found reprehenſible; even after receiving

               <!-- PDF PAGE 20 -->the holy Ghoſt, and as great confirmation and riveting in faith and piety, as humane nature is capable of: if then any miſapprehenſion, or miſtaking ſhould creep into their Councells, and their Orders or Lawes thereupon prove er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, and unwarrantable; how lamentable a caſe were it, that the godly tender-hearted that are in the right (as they muſt be that oppoſe them) ſhould ſuffer either in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or Eſtates, for adhereing to truth and Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>Certainly the rule which Chriſt preſcribeth of giving to <hi>Caeſar thoſe things which are Caeſars, and to God what is his,</hi> doth fully determine this point, and ſetteth a period to all further queſtions about it; Reverence, Duty, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in temporall matters belong to the civill Magiſtrate, and whoſoever ſhall breake the tye of civill Society, let him ſuffer for it, by the hand of humane Iuſtice; But to take Gods owne peculiar worke out of his hand, let no man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume: He onely hath the flood-gates of Grace in his power; he onely can ſpeake to our hearts, and from his whiſpers and inſtructions onely can true Religion be derived. To his infinite goodneſſe then, let that taske be wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred; It is our part to pray, and uſe ſuch other helpes for the inſtructing of others as God hath directed in his word, but his onely with power to effect it.</p>
            <p>But peradventure you will aske then, whether the godly may uſe no weapon againſt thoſe that have a ſpirituall War with them by being different in their Iudgement, &amp; practice? yes ſurely (if it be ſinfull) they may uſe that weapon which God hath put into their hand to ſight with in this Cauſe; It is aſpitituall weapon, and therfore proportionable to a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conflict; Let wicked perſons and unbelievers bee cut off from the reſt of the Church, by the ſword of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, not from the world by the Sword of Juſtice: for that is directly contrary to the Apoſtles rule.</p>

            <p>In this particular, where he appointeth the uſe of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and telleth the Church, they muſt with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence expect repentance and amendment from ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; which expectance being ordained by the Holy Ghoſt, ſurely it muſt be a great impiety, to diſobey this Divine Conſtitution, and preſſe further by any impious zeale, to extirpate by civill power thoſe plants, that are blaſted by a ſpirituall breath; ſo that the reſult of this diſcourſe is, that it cannot be hoped, that any <hi>Kingdome</hi> or State, ſhould be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, or flouriſh under Gods bleſſing, untill all mens hearts are united together, and made to concurre joynely, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly, in advanceing the temporall intereſts of it, by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans being ſecured, and quieted in the poſſeſſion of his ſpirituall ones, which can be done no way but by free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in matters of Religion; wherein though a certaine tenor of Faith and forme of Divine Worſhip be agreed of, and eſtabliſhed in generall for thoſe that have their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, moulded that way; yet others, that cannot yeild their aſſent thereunto, may to themſelves enjoy the freedome of their conſcienes as long as they do nothing to interrupt the civill ſociety.</p>
            <p>And if any worldly man, that taketh a ſcantling of the wayes of God by a humane meaſure, ſhould apprehend that ſuch a toleration (as men call it) might in tract of time ſuffer a falſe Doctrine to take ſo deepe roote, as at length it may grow ſo ſtrong, and ſpread ſo wide, that the now preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent party may in the end be put to the worſt, and when they are growne to be the weakeſt ſide, may not be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch moderation as is now deſired at their hands.</p>

            <p>I ſhall but deſire him to examine ſeriouſly and calmely, in the particular progreſſe that muſt bee allowed to ſuch a turne, how improbable, or rather impoſſible it is; And not content himſelfe, with a ſpecious objection, drawne from generalls, that in their due ſenſe are true; but are wreſted in their application to this purpoſe, let him conſider, how unlikely it is that falſhood ſhould prevaile againſt truth (for ſo he conceiveth it) when it carrieth with it no bias of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane advantage, to warpe mens mindes that way: number, power and reputation, is yet of his ſide, what ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſupplant it? what invitements, or allurements, hath the other, to bewitch men to forſake Divine truth, to their temporall prejudice? for all the advantage the other can boaſt of, is but impunity. It is diſcountenanced, they have power, are not cheriſhing Fathers, nor nurceing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to it; It hath no weapons to fight with; it muſt wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle naked againſt the others advantagious Armes, ſo remote a Providence then, or rather ſuch a diſtruſt, argueth ſome ſecret conſciouſneſſe of inward deficiency and weakneſſe, and then, why ſhould they not conclude with <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> that if the Doctrine, whoſe progreſſe they apprehend be of God, it is not in their Power, nor of all mankind together to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the growth of it?</p>
            <p>But if they believe it falſe, and are firmely perſwaded of the perfection and verity of their owne; they ſhould not doubt, but that God who made the Aegyptian Magicians ſtickes breake in pieces at their Encounter, with <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, And that made <hi>Dagon</hi> fall to the ground at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Arke, and that conſumed <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts with ſire, When they ſtood Competition with his true Prophet, will alſo unmaske the Counterfeit beauties of a falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when it raiſeth it ſelfe agaiſt the true one, and hath no ſupport of temporall Advantages, to underprop it.</p>

Now that which I draw from the former grounds, and upon which I conclude the truth of my conceit, is, that as it doth in every part ſingularly well agree with it ſelfe, ſo no way thwarting, but agreeing alſo moſt fully with theſe ſeven things, <hi>viz.</hi> Election, Predeſtination, Grace, Faith, Redemption, Religion, and with God. and that with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven things in the nature of God, <hi>viz.</hi> his infinite Eſſence or Law of his omnipotent power; his excellent wiſedome, his wonderfull Goodneſſe, his free love, his exact Iuſtice, his unſpeakeable mercy, and his unfaylable truth, all which may be declared in their place.</p>
